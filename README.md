Demonstration of a pizza shop online ordering site built with Craft CMS + Commerce and a custom module to add on the costs of extra pizza toppings.

Starting database in `/startingdb`

A few pizzas and toppings are set up as Commerce products. The toppings use a custom table field to set prices for the different sizes. This could be done with variants I suppose, but it felt clumsy. Since we aren't really using the Commerce Price field for Toppings it might be preferable to just make them Entries instead.

This is by no means complete, just a few templates to demonstrate the process of adding pizzas to an order and customising the toppings. I haven't built a checkout but might do that as a means to figure out some ideas I have.

On the subject of templates, these are a bit mangled as I was trying out some ideas for structuring templates.

Oh, and it uses Tailwind CDN just for speed. Not keen.
